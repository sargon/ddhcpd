A Distributed DHCP Daemon
=========================

In self managed networks with decentralized client realms a central DHCP
server is not available. DDHCP allows every realm to have his own server;
preserving roaming features for the client, by maintaining a common
consens on dhcp leases.

The implementation is flexible, meaning we do not prevent you from doing
stupid stuff, but also allow you maximal adaption.

    Usage: ddhcp [-h] [-d|-D] [-L] [-c CLT-IFACE|-S] [-i SRV-IFACE] [-t TENTATIVE-TIMEOUT]

    -h                     This usage information.
    -c CLT-IFACE           Interface on which requests from clients are handled
    -i SRV-IFACE           Interface on which different servers communicate
    -S                     no Client interface
    -t TENTATIVE           Time required for a block to be claimed
    -N NETWORK/CIDR        Network to announce and manage blocks in
    -o CODE:LEN:P1. .. .Pn DHCP Option with code,len and #len chars in decimal
    -b BLKSIZEPOW          Power over two of block size
    -s SPAREBLKS           Amount of spare blocks
    -L                     Deactivate learning phase
    -d                     Run in background and daemonize
    -D                     Run in foreground and log to console (default)
    -C CTRL_PATH           Path to control socket
    -H COMMAND             Hook to call on events
    -V                     Print build revision
    -v                     Increase verbosity, may be specified multiple times

Build
-----

To build a production binary of ddhcpd just

    make clean all

, if you want more logging output

    CFLAGS="-D LOG_LEVEL=20"

or debug symbols and more logging

    DEBUG=1 CFLAGS="-D LOG_LEVEL=20" make clean all

Depending on the choosen variant the binary size may variate between 
30kb and 500kb.

Running
-------

On a gluon node the command should look this:

    ddhcpd -o "3:4:10.116.254.254" -o "1:4:255.255.128.0" -o "28:4:10.116.254.255" -N 10.116.224.0/20 -b 2 -s 1 -c br-client -i bat0

We are able to register dhcp options during startup and also during runtime.
Using the ddhcpdctl binary, to add i.e. the standard gateway:

    ddhcpdctl -o "3:4:10.116.254.253"

or an emerged timeserver 

    ddhcpdctl -o "42:4:10.116.254.252"

,and remove:.

    ddhcpdctl -r "42"

Be careful with this, as expressed above we do not save you from doing dumb things.

Hook
----

If you want to act on events, you can register a binary via the '-H' 
command. On every event that binary will be called given a list of arguments:

  <command> [lease|release] <ip-addr> <hwaddr>

Testing
-------

The network-test script setups a set of virtual interfaces
which are composed of server and client interface pairs. 
Those are called srvX for daemons and cltX for clients inside of the main 
network namespace and server0 and client0 in the ''daemons'' network namespaces.
All srvX interfaces are bridged in br-srv; enabling all daemons to communicate
bidirectional.

Inside of the daemons network namespace the client0 interface has the address 10.0.0.1/20,
a ipv4 address is needed here, because the dhcp part of ddhcp binds on this interface.
It is the same address in every daemon namespace, since cltX interfaces are not
bridged that is no problem. On the server0 interface we need no ipv4 address, 
because d2d communication is handled via ipv6 multicast/unicast on the local link.

To setup a basic ddhcp network testing enviroment by calling

    # ./network-test net-init <number>

to create a virtual network for <number> of ddhcp instances. You
will need to have priviledges to create network namespaces. Short
use sudo and check the network-test script upfront.

To start the (n-1)-th instance of ddhcp in your test environment, use 

    # ./network-test srv-start <n> ./ddhcp -t 3

Above also reduces the tentative timeout from 12 to 3 seconds, 
speeds up testing.

After starting multiple instances, we generate dhcp request against specific 
instances of ddhcpd by starting dhcp clients pointed to the cltX interfaces,
i.e.

    # dhclient -sf /dev/null -d -v clt0

for the first ddhcp instance. To create multiple parallel running clients
with different mac addresses, do:.

   # ./network-test clt-start <n>

To deconfigure the setup call:.

    # ./network-test net-stop

A simple testing routine incorporating all above:.

    # ./network-test test
